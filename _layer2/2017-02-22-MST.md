Multiple Spanning Tree (MST) was developed to overcome the high resource requirements of PVST. In reality, there are only a few logical redundant design on a network, regardless of the number of VLANs or the number of physical links. With MST you can run several different logical topologies (instances), and map VLANs to those instances. You get the benefit of running a redundant, fully utilized network without the resource overhead on the switches.

So the end result is that with PVST, a port is either forwarding or discarding for a VLAN, while with MST, a port is either forwarding or discarding for an instance which contains multiple VLANs.

MST is defined by IEEE 802.1s. A special instance, instance 0 or the Internal Spanning Tree (IST), is designated to carry all STP information. The BPDUs for IST carry all the standard RSTP information, as well as the configuration name, revision number, and a *hash value* calculated over the VLAN to instance mapping.

You should not run MSTP on access ports.
