PortFast is used in Spanning Tree to avoid the lengthy delay of the Listening and Learning phases during STP convergence. When PortFast is enabled on an interface, the interface skips the Listening and Learning phases and goes straight into the Forwarding state. PortFast should be used on access switches on ports where you know end devices will be plugged in.

To enable PortFast on an interface, in interface sub configuration mode use `spanning-tree portfast`. If it is a trunk you must append the `trunk` keyword after the command, and if it is an access port you should use the `edge` keyword.

Another way to enable PortFast for access ports is to use `spanning-tree portfast default` in global configuration mode. Once enabled, all access ports will automatically have PortFast enabled.
