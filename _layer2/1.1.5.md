#### Trunks
Dot1q is the standard trunking protocol used for transporting multiple VLANs across a trunk port. A trunk is a point-to-point link that carries the traffic for multiple VLANs across a single trunk. Dot1q is a standard that tags VLANs for identification. The receiving switch will then strip the VLAN tag from the frame before passing it to the appropriate access port.

The full name for Dot1q is IEEE 802.1Q.

The 802.1Q Tagged frame looks like this:
![][image-1]

- The PRI field is the 3-bit 802.1p priority field.
- The CFI field is always set to 0 for Ethernet switches
- VLAN ID is a 12-bit field

Because of the extra fields, an 802.1Q frame has an MTU of 1522 bytes.

If a non-802.1Q enabled device or an access port receives a tagged frame, it simply ignores the frame and forwards it as usual.

#### Native VLAN
A Native VLAN on a trunk is the VLAN to which untagged traffic belongs. Across a trunk, the Native VLANs should match on each end.

`SW1# show interface trunk`

will show the Native VLAN for each interface that has active trunking.
