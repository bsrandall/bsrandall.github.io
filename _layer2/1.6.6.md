SPAN is a method to map traffic from one port to another port or VLAN. The destination port could also be mapped to a port on a remote switch, in which case we call it Remote SPAN or RSPAN. In RSPAN, a specific VLAN must be configured across the entire switching path from the source port or VLAN to the RSPAN destination port. So the source is still at least one port or at least one VLAN,  but the destination is always the RSPAN VLAN. At the switch where the RSPAN destination port exists, the RSPAN VLAN is delivered to the RSPAN port.

RSPAN sample configuration. We will monitor all traffic on VLANs 66-68 on SW1 and send it to VLAN 199, which will then be delivered to port fa0/24 on SW2:

```
SW1(config)# vlan 199
SW1(config-vlan)# remote span
SW1(config-vlan)# exit
SW1(config)# monitor session 1 source vlan 66-68
SW1(config)# monitor session 1 destination remote van 199
```
```
SW2(config)# vlan 199
SW2(config-vlan)# remote span
SW2(config-vlan)# exit
SW2(config)# monitor session 2 source remote vlan 199
SW2(config)# monitor session 2 destination interface fa0/24
```

Notice above that the monitor session numbers do not have to match on each switch.
