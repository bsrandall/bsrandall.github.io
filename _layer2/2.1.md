HDLC is a Layer 2 protocol - the Cisco version is a slight tweak from the original ISO version, so Cisco HDLC will not operate with HDLC implementations from other vendors. It is used on serial interfaces to make direct connections between routers. It is actually the default point-to-point serial protocol for Cisco routers, but PPP is more commonly used.

You must always remember when connecting two serial interfaces, the DCE side must set a clock rate.

If you are changing back from PPP to HDLC, the following shows how you would accomplish it.
```
R1(config)# interface serial0/0
R1(config-if)# encapsulation hdlc
```
