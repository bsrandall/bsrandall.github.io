      <p>SPAN stands for Switch Port Analyzer. It is a way to direct all traffic from a source port or source VLAN to a single port. Some uses include IDS/IPS, VoIP Call recording, or troubleshooting / analysis.</p>

<p>If the destination port is on the local switch, we say it is in SPAN operation mode. The destination port could also be mapped to a port on a remote switch, in which case we call it Remote SPAN or RSPAN. In RSPAN, a specific VLAN must be configured across the entire switching path from the source port or VLAN to the RSPAN destination port. So the source is still at least one port or at least one VLAN,  but the destination is always the RSPAN VLAN. At the switch where the RSPAN destination port exists, the RSPAN VLAN is delivered to the RSPAN port.</p>

<p>Encapsulated Remote SPAN (ERSPAN) is a variant of RSPAN in which we are encapsulating the Remote SPAN information. ERSPAN creates a GRE tunnel for all captured traffic and allows it to be extended across Layer 3 domains. This became an option with IOS-XE.</p>

<p>Regardless of the type of SPAN we are running, the source port can be any type of port including EtherChannel, trunk port, routed port, etc. When using a VLAN as the source, all active ports in that VLAN are monitored, and the monitored ports are updated dynamically as membership to that VLAN changes. A port configured as a SPAN destination cannot be part of a SPAN source VLAN.</p>

<p>It is important to understand that when you configure a SPAN destination port, the existing configuration is removed but is restored if you later remove the SPAN configuration. The destination port does not support any security, nor does it support any Layer 2 protocols such as CDP, VTP, etc. If the destination port was part of an EtherChannel, it will be removed from the EtherChannel once the SPAN configuration is applied.</p>

<p>There are a number of restrictions with SPAN including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the source can be one or more ports or a VLAN, but not both</li>
  <li>up to 64 destination ports can be configured on a switch</li>
  <li>you must be careful not to overload the destination port, especially if a VLAN is being monitored.</li>
  <li>within a single SPAN session, you cannot deliver traffic to a destination port when it is sourced by a mix of SPAN, RSPAN, or ERSPAN source ports or VLANs. This usually comes into play when you want to mirror source traffic to both a local port on a switch (SPAN mode) and a remote port on another switch (RSPAN mode).</li>
  <li>only one SPAN/RSPAN/ERSPAN session can send traffic to a single destination port</li>
  <li>if you use a trunk port as a SPAN or RSPAN source, then by default all VLANs on the trunk are monitored by default</li>
  <li>traffic that is routed from another VLAN to a source VLAN cannot be monitored with SPAN</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, SPAN, RSPAN, and ERSPAN support three types of traffic: transmitted, received, and both (default). If you set a SPAN to monitor just receive or just transmit, some conditions apply:</p>
<ul>
  <li>for Receive (RX) the goal is to deliver all traffic that is received by the SPAN source. As a result, each frame that is received by the source port or VLAN is copied to the destination port or VLAN <em>before</em> any modifications are made to the frame (such as ACL filtering, QoS, etc)</li>
  <li>for Transmit (TX), all relevant filtering or modification to the frame is done before the switch forwards the traffic to the SPAN or RSPAN destination.</li>
  <li>SPAN usually ignores certain Layer 2 frames like CDP, BPDUs, etc. However, SPAN can be configured to forward that traffic to the destination port/VLAN with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">encapsulation replicate</code> command</li>
</ul>

<p>Imagine in the above diagram that H1 sends out an ARP request, which is a broadcast frame. SW1 will forward this broadcast frame on ports Fa0/0 and Fa1/0 toward SW2.</p>

<p>SW2 will forward the broadcast frame it received on Fa0/0 out Fa1/0 and the interface connected to H2. This cycle will continue and continue. By introducing redundancy, we have created an environment that is friendly to Layer 2 loops. And since Ethernet frames do not have a TTL, they will loop around forever.</p>

<p>Spanning Tree is a Layer 2 protocol that was created to deal with the possible loop creation that is introduced with redundant Layer 2 loops. Spanning Tree takes over the Layer 2 forwarding decisions, and places certain ports in a blocking state to prevent the possibility of these loops occurring.</p>

<p>When Spanning Tree is enabled, switches send out a special frame called a BPDU (Bridge Protocol Data Unit). Included in this BPDU is the Switch’s Priority and MAC Address, which concatenated equals the Bridge Id. Among connected Switch’s, the Switch with the lowest Bridge Id becomes the Root Bridge.</p>

<p>A Root Bridge marks all of its ports as Designated, which are placed in a forwarding state. Designated ports lead away from the Root bridge.</p>

<p>For the remaining switches, we have to elect one root port on each switch. The root port will be the port whose path has the lowest cost to the root bridge</p>

      <p>Common Spanning-Tree (CST) assumes one spanning-tree instance for the entire bridged network, regardless of the number of VLANs. Running only one instance reduces CPU load. All CST BPDUs are sent over trunks using the native VLAN with untagged frames.</p>

      <p>UDLD, or Unidirectional Link Detection, is a Cisco proprietary, Layer 2 protocol that helps detects if either the transmit or the receive fails on a link. It’s purpose is similar to LoopGuard, but it is completely independent of Spanning Tree. The operation of UDLD is fairly simple. A switch sends UDLD Hellos and if it receives echoes of those Hellos back it knows the link is an active two way link. As soon as it quits receiving the UDLD Hellos, it knows there must be a unidirectional link failure. UDLD operates at the physical port level, compared to say STP LoopGuard which works at the logical port level (EtherChannel). Also UDLD functions at linkup, while LoopGuard does not. It is recommended to enable both UDLD and LoopGuard.</p>

<p>UDLD is mainly used on fiber connections, but it can also be useful on Ethernet connections that have dumb devices in the middle such as media converters.</p>

<p>The default advertisement timer is 15 seconds and the hold time is 5 seconds. Upon detecting the loss of a UDLD neighbor, UDLD will send seven additional advertisements (one per second). If no reply is received, the link’s bidirectional status transitions to unknown.</p>

<p>To set up UDLD globally, use <code class="highlighter-rouge">SW1(config)# udld enable</code> and use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">SW1(config-if)# udld port enable</code> command to enable per interface. Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">SW1(config)# udld enable aggressive</code> if you want the ports to be shut down upon UDLD neighbor failure.</p>

<p>In order to reset an interface that was shut down by UDLD, use <code class="highlighter-rouge">SW1# udld reset</code>, or the typical shut / no shut commands.</p>

<p>You could also enable auto recovery of the interface if desired. It would look like this:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>SW1(config)# errdisable recovery cause idled
SW1(config)# errdisable recovery interval 30
</code></pre>

        LLDP

    <article>
      <p>LLDP is the IEEE equivalent of CDP. It’s development was due to Cisco’s deployment of CDP, so the IEEE sought to make a universal version. It is very similar to CDP and many of the Cisco commands for LLDP are the same commands as those for CDP, just substituting lldp for cdp. Like CDP, LLDP is a link layer protocol, but unlike CDP it is specifically for Ethernet networks. LLDP is described under IEEE 802.1AB LLDP.</p>

<p>LLDP, like CDP, also uses TLVs to describe neighbor devices and capabilities.</p>

<p>One additional feature LLDP includes is that LLDP has a TLV for an interface description, so if you set a description with <code class="highlighter-rouge">SW1#(config-if) description LINK_SW1_SW2</code>, that description would show up under Switch 2 LLDP like this:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>SW2# show lldp neighbors detail

Chasis id: 0019.569d.571a
Port id: Fa0/24
Port Description: LINK_SW1_SW2
System Name: SW1.cisco.com
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>An enhancement was made to LLDP that allows you to use LLDP for VLAN assignment or POE requirements. This enhanced version is known as LLDP-MED (Media Endpoint Discovery).</p>

<p>One difference between CDP and LLDP is that with LLDP the Hello timer is set to 30 seconds by default and the hold time is set to 4 times the Hello time. CDP is 60 seconds and the hold timer is 3 times the Hello time, as a reminder. Another difference is that LLDP has a reinitialization delay (default 2 seconds).  This is the time that an LLDP port waits before reinitializing LLDP transmission. The command to set the reinitialization period is <code class="highlighter-rouge">SW1#(config) lldp reinit</code>.</p>

<p>You can also set LLDP up to only transmit and not receive LLDP packets. This is done by using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">SW1#(config) no lldp receive</code> command. You can also do this on a per-interface basis. Likewise, you can also disallow sending LLDP packets with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">SW1#(config) no lldp transmit</code> command, which can also be done at the interface level.</p>
