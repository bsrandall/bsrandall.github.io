    <article>
      <p>BackboneFast enables fast reconvergence due to indirect link failures. The key operation happens when a switch begins receiving inferior BPDUs.  When a switch loses the link off its Root Port, it immediately starts sending BPDUs announcing itself as the new Root. Usually, when a switch receives inferior BPDUs, it will wait for its Max Age timer to expire before beginning STP convergence. Once its Max Age timer expires, the inferior BPDU ages out and the switch will then forward its superior BPDU to the neighbor switch who was sending the inferior BPDU.</p>

<p>When BackboneFast is enabled, as soon as a switch receives an inferior BPDU, it will send RLQ (Root Link Query) messages out all it’s non-designated ports. The RLQ asks other switches if the current Root Bridge is accessible via that switch. Note it doesn’t wait for its Max Age timer to expire - it begins sending RLQ messages immediately. The RLQ is a new type of PDU defined within the BackboneFast specification. The RLQ is essentially a proactive way to age out ports compared to just waiting on the Max Age timer to expire.</p>

<p>Based on the received RLQ responses, the switch will update its root ports and designated ports accordingly.. However all ports still transition through the regular IEEE 802.1D STP port states - listening, learning, and forwarding/blocking.</p>

<p>To enable BackboneFast use the command <code class="highlighter-rouge">spanning-tree backbonefast</code> on all switches in the Layer 2 domain. The easiest way to verify that BackboneFast is enabled is to use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">show spanning-tree summary</code> command.</p>

<p>This is a great Cisco article describing the operation: <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/lan-switching/spanning-tree-protocol/12014-18.html">BackboneFast</a>.</p>

      <p>There are 3 timers we need to be concerned with in Spanning Tree: the Hello Time, the Forward Delay, and the Max-Age Time.</p>

<p>The Hello Time is the frequency with which BPDUs are transmitted from the root bridge. It can be adjusted with the command <code class="highlighter-rouge">spanning-tree vlan 1-4094 hello-time 3</code> where 3 is in seconds. The default is 2 seconds, but in can be adjusted between 1 and 10 seconds. Non-root bridges will never generate BPDUs, but only relay BPDUs they receive on their root port.</p>

<p>The Forward Delay is the time that is spent in the listening and learning states. Its value is 15 seconds by default, but it can be adjusted to anywhere between 4 and 30 seconds.</p>

<p>The Max Age timer controls the maximum length of time that passes before a bridge port saves its configuration BPDU. This time is 20 seconds by default, but it can be tuned to be anytime between 6 and 40 seconds.</p>

<p>There is another item that is not a timer but is related. This is the <em>message age</em>. The root bridge sends all of its BPDUs with a message age of 0. Each downstream switch then adds 1 to this message age value. The actual age out time of the downstream switches is then (max age - message age).</p>

<p>Here is a good article that describes the Max Age timer as it relates to superior BPDUs:  <a href="https://packetmagnifier.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/understanding-stp-max-age/">Max Age</a>. If a switch’s root port goes down, there is no need for it to go through the Max Age timer process - if there are no better BPDUs received, the switch will immediately start announcing itself as root and begin sending BPDUs. In the scenario in the article, the switch that went down is sending inferior BPDUs, but yet the receiving switch goes through the Max Age process before it transforms its non-designated port to a Designated Port and begins sending the superior BPDUs towards the switch that suffered the down link.</p>

        STP Path Selection with Port Cost

      <p>There are two ways we can alter STP Path selection. We can alter the cost of a port, or we can change the priority of a port.</p>

<p>When a switch receives a BPDU, that BPDU contains the root path cost from the previous switch. The receiving switch then adds the cost of the link between it and the sending switch from which it received the BPDU. That is very important - it is the receiving switch that adds the cost associated with its interface to the Root Path Cost it received from the sending switch.</p>

<p>Cost is used for the selection of the root port to the upstream switch.</p>

<p>Priority is used for influencing the root port of the downstream switch, and as such, it is set up on a port in Designated state. Cost has a higher precedence than priority. You will see priority on the local switch <code class="highlighter-rouge">show spanning-tree vlan 2</code> but it will actually affect the forwarding decision on the downstream connected switch.</p>

        STP Root Bridge Election

    <article>
      <p>STP Root Bridge Election is based on the Bridge ID of the switches in the active Layer 2 domain. The Bridge ID is made up of the 4-bit bridge priority, a 12-bit Systems ID, and the 48-bit MAC address. The bridge priority is configurable from 0 to 61440. The default is 32768. The System ID is taken from the VLAN number (IEEE 802.1t).</p>

<p>The election process is very simple. Each bridge starts off assuming it is the Root Bridge and sends BPDUs out advertising itself as such. If it receives a superior BPDU (a BPDU that has a Bridge ID lower than its current root bridge Bridge ID), it ceases advertising that Root Bridge and begins advertising the new Root Bridge with the lower Bridge ID. This process continues until all switches in the domain agree to the same Root Bridge.</p>

<p>Note that since MAC addresses are guaranteed to be unique, there will always be 1 Root Bridge elected. If all switches are set to the default priority, then the switch with the lowest MAC Address will become the Root Bridge. this is a bad idea for many reasons. One, you typically want your distribution layer switch to be the Root Bridge. Second, older switches will have lower MAC addresses, so your switch with the least resources ends up having a heavier load along with a higher chance for failure</p>
