    <article>
      <p>LACP is the IEEE standard for establishing a single logical channel out of several physical ports. It is popular as it can be used in mixed-vendor switch environments. LACP ensures that when an EtherChannel is created, all physical members all have the same speed, duplex, link-type, and VLAN information. LACP is a control protocol for LAG. The official name is IEEE 802.3ad Link Aggregation (LAG).</p>

<p>LACP supports up to 16 Ethernet ports of the same type. Up to eight ports can be active, and up to eight ports can be in standby mode.</p>

<p>LACP assigns system priority, port priority, and and an administrative key.</p>

<p><em>System priority</em> and the MAC address form the System ID. Between two LACP neighbors, the switch with the lowest System ID will be the decision maker using the LACP Port Priority</p>

<p><em>Port priority</em> and the port number form the port identifier. The switch uses the port identifier to decide which ports to put in standby mode when a hardware limitation prevents all ports from aggregating. Port priority is also used when more than 8 physical ports are put into a channel group. Port priority will decide which 8 ports will be the active ports in the etherchannel.</p>

<p><em>Administrative key</em> defines the capabilities of a port to aggregate with other ports, based on the port’s physical characteristics.</p>

<p>Sample Configuration:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>SW1# interface range GigabitEthernet0/1-2
SW1# channel-group 1 mode active
SW1# exit
SW1# interface port-channel 1
SW1# switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
SW1# switchport mode trunk
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>SW2# interface range GigabitEthernet0/1-2
SW2# channel-group 1 mode active
SW2# exit
SW2# interface port-channel 1
SW2# switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
SW2# switchport mode trunk
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can also start with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">interface port-channel 1</code> command and then define the channel group. For Layer 3 ether channel, you would want to define the port-channel first and then issue the <code class="highlighter-rouge">no switchport</code> interface command.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">interface port-channel 1</code> is the logical interface. The channel-group command binds the logical interface to a physical port. The port-channel interface (numbered 1 - 48) correspond to the one specified with the channel-group interface configuration command.</p>

<p>A successful Layer 2 EtherChannel will show SU with the command <code class="highlighter-rouge">show etherchannel summary</code>. An unsuccessful layer 2 will show SD.</p>

      <p>IST is the Internal Spanning Tree, also known as instance 0. This instance is designated to carry all STP information, including information from other instances. MSTP does not send BPDUs for ever instance separately - these are all contained within the IST BPDU.</p>

<p>To accommodate, the other instances information is carried within the IST BPDU using special M-Record fields - one for every active MSTI. These fields carry carry MSTP information such as bridge priority, root path cost, and port priority.</p>

<p>IST also plays a huge role in multiple MSTP region configurations. When a switch receives a BPDU from another region, it marks the corresponding port as MSTP <em>boundary</em>. The interconnected, different region switches then form a CIST spanning across the regions.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.ine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/mstp-3-multi-region-physical-topology.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Remember, an IST is internal to a region while a CIST is the IST spanning across multiple regions.</p>

<p>Here is a sample MST BPDU:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.ine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/mstp-3-multi-region-cst-mstp-packet-format.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The CIST Root is elected among all regions while the CIST Regional Root is elected in every region. The IST Root = CIST Regional Root in cases where multiple MST regions interoperate. The CIST Root is the bridge that has the lowest Bridge Id among all regions - the CIST Root could be a bridge inside a region or a boundary switch in a region. The CIST Regional Root is a <em>boundary switch</em> elected for every region based on the shortest external path cost to reach the CIST Root. As mentioned above, it is important to remember that the CIST Regional Root becomes the root of the IST for the given region as well - the region changes its IST election process to make the CIST Regional Root the IST root.</p>

<p>When an MST switch boots up, it declares itself the CIST Root and CIST Regional Root and announce that it its outgoing BPDUs on all internal ports. On boundary ports (those that have received BPDUs from another region), the switch will only advertise its CIST Root Bridge ID and CIST External Root Path Cost, hiding the details of the region’s inner topology.</p>

<p>The region that contains the CIST Root automatically places all of its boundary ports in an unblocked state.</p>

<p>The <em>CIST External Root Path Cost</em> is the cost to reach the CIST Root across the links connecting the boundary ports. When a BPDU is received on an internal link, this cost is not changed.</p>

<p>Only a boundary switch can be elected as the CIST Regional Root, and this is the switch with the lowest cost to reach the CIST Root. If a boundary switch receives a BPDU with a lower CIST External Root Path cost on one of its internal ports, it will stop announcing itself as the CIST Regional Root and start announcing the new metric out of its boundary ports.</p>

<p>If a switch is a CIST Regional Root, it elects one of its boundary ports as the CIST Root port and blocks all other boundary ports. If a boundary switch is not the CIST Regional Root, it will mark its boundary ports as Designated or Alternate, Designate only if it has a better External Root Path cost or in case of a tie, lower CIST Regional Root Bridge ID.</p>

<p>The regional MSTIs are constructed independently at every region, but they have to be mapped to the CIST at the boundary ports. This equates to the inability to load-balance VLAN traffic on the boundary links by mapping VLANs to different instances.</p>

<p>A topology change in the CST could change all paths in the topology thus requiring massive MAC address relearning.</p>

      <p>LAG goal is to trick our Spanning Tree Protocol into forwarding active/active across multiple links. The risk we take is an infinite loop in the data plane, as there is no TTL with Ethernet. The LAG negotiation protocols help to mitigate this risk. Static LAG is supported but not recommended, as a failure to LAG can cause an STP Loop. If you do deploy Static LAG, it is recommended to deploy EtherChannel Guard to help mitigate the chances of a loop.</p>

<p>PAgP and LACP accomplish the exact same thing, just in different ways.</p>

<p>Since both PAgP and LACP both require the member ports to have the same characteristics, a good command to start with is <code class="highlighter-rouge">show interfaces status</code>.</p>

      <p>The principal of VTP pruning is if a client sends a broadcast to its connected switch’s access port, that switch will flood the broadcast to all other connected switches in the VTP / Layer 2 domain. Because of VTP, all the other switches would be aware of the client VLAN, and would thus be required to flood the broadcast to all other switches.</p>

<p>But what if the other switches do not have any clients connected to access ports in that VLAN? They are still having to process the request, and the network segment still has to bear the broadcast traffic.</p>

<p>When you enable VTP pruning, you are enabling it for the entire VTP domain.</p>

    <article>
      <p>Multiple Spanning Tree (MST) was developed to overcome the high resource requirements of PVST. In reality, there are only a few logical redundant design on a network, regardless of the number of VLANs or the number of physical links. With MST you can run several different logical topologies (instances), and map VLANs to those instances. You get the benefit of running a redundant, fully utilized network without the resource overhead on the switches.</p>

<p>So the end result is that with PVST, a port is either forwarding or discarding for a VLAN, while with MST, a port is either forwarding or discarding for an instance which contains multiple VLANs.</p>

<p>MST is defined by IEEE 802.1s. A special instance, instance 0 or the Internal Spanning Tree (IST), is designated to carry all STP information. The BPDUs for IST carry all the standard RSTP information, as well as the configuration name, revision number, and a <em>hash value</em> calculated over the VLAN to instance mapping.</p>

<p>You should not run MSTP on access ports.</p>
