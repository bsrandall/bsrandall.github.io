    <article>
      <p>Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) is used by IPv6 hosts and routers for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)</li>
  <li>Duplicate Address Detection</li>
  <li>for Layer-2 Data-Link address resolution (similar to IPv4 ARP)</li>
  <li>to determine if neighbors are reachable (Neighbor Unreachability Detection)</li>
  <li>when a router fails, a host actively searches for functioning alternates.</li>
</ul>

<p>Neighbor Discovery uses 5 ICMPv6 messages:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Router Solicitation message</li>
  <li>Router Advertisement message</li>
  <li>Neighbor Solicitation message</li>
  <li>Neighbor Advertisement message</li>
  <li>Redirect message</li>
</ol>

<p>Router Solicitation messages are used by hosts when it needs prefix, prefix length, default gateway, and other information for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC). Router Advertisement messages are the messages used by Routers to convey that information to hosts.</p>

<p>Neighbor Solicitation and Neighbor Advertisement messages are two more protocols that use ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery. These messages are used by a device to request Layer 2 link layer address information from another device on the same network or to provide this information to the requesting device. Neighbor Solicitation and Neighbor Advertisement messages are part of three important processes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Address resolution</li>
  <li>Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)</li>
  <li>Neighbor Unreachability Detection (DUD)</li>
</ol>

<p>An IPv6 host will maintain two tables for each interface:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Neighbor cache</li>
  <li>Destination Cache</li>
</ul>

<p>The Neighbor cache is equivalent to an ARP table in IPv4. The neighbor cache contains mappings of hosts on the same network, while the destination cache contains layer-2 to layer-3 resolutions for devices on other links or networks.  To see the Neighbor table, issue <code class="highlighter-rouge">show ipv6 neighbors</code> command.</p>

    <article>
      <p>There are 3 types of IPv6 addresses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unicast</li>
  <li>Anycast</li>
  <li>Multicast</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no “broadcast” type as in IPv4, but an “all nodes” multicast address does exist, which essentially serves the same purpose.</p>
<h4 id="unicast">Unicast</h4>
<p>A unicast address is an address that identifies a single device. A <em>global</em> unicast address is one that is assigned to a single host and is globally unique. These are the equivalent of a routable IPv4 address.
<a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/i/300001-400000/330001-340000/330001-331000/330523.tif/_jcr_content/renditions/330523.jpg">link</a>
The host portion of the address is called the Interface ID. This is a more accurate description as a host can have more than one address (as can an interface, but often not).</p>

<p>IPv6 addresses, unlike IPv4 addresses, have the subnet bits built in as part of the network portion of the address. In IPv4, the subnet bits were borrowed from the host portion. One benefit from this is that the Interface ID can be a consistent length for all IPv6 addresses, simplifying parsing of the address. The Interface ID, with very few exceptions, is 64 bits long. Also, with very few exceptions, the Subnet ID field is 16 bits long, providing for 65,636 separate subnets. This leaves 48 bits for the Global Routing Prefix of the address.</p>

<p>The currently allocated IPv6 global unicast addresses are 2xxx::/4 through 3xxx::/4. The most common allocation is a /48 global routing prefix, a 16-bit subnet ID, and a 64 bit Interface ID.</p>

<p>IPv6 also has <em>link-local</em> unicast address in addition to the global unicast address type. The difference is that a link-local address’ scope is limited to a single link, and its uniqueness in not guaranteed outside of that link. The first 10 bits are always FE80 (1111111010). Link-local addresses have great utility for functions like Neighbor Discovery Protocol and Address Autoconfiguration. They are similar to the 169.254.0.0/16 in IPv4. Link local addresses are never routable. Below is an example configuration in which you will see a subnet is not even declared.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>`R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# ipv6 address FE80::1 link-local
R1config-if)# exit
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>`Link-local addresses are significant only within a single link. Packets with link-local sources or destinations are mostly used by the router’s control plane protocols, such as IPv6 routing protocols.</p>

<p>There is also <em>unique-local</em> IPv6 addresses. These are equivalent to IPv4 RFC1918 addresses. They are likely unique, but not routable via global BGP. Thee always start with FC00::/7.</p>

<h4 id="anycast">Anycast</h4>
<p>An any cast address really represents more of a service than an address. An any cast address can reside on multiple hosts. Routers do not know they reside on different hosts but assume that they have multiple routes to the same host, so a single router simply choses the route to which it has the lowest cost route. Anycast also offers reliable backup, for if a single device goes down, routers will just route to the next lowest-cost available server. There are some reserved Anycast addresses, but for most services, an anycast address is just a global unicast address providing the any cast service.</p>

<h4 id="multicast">Multicast</h4>
<p>A multicast address identifies a set of devices - a <em>multicast group</em>. The first 8 bits of a multicast address are always 1s (FF00). The next 4 bits are the Flags. The following 4 bits are the Scope. Finally, the last 112 bits represent the Group ID.</p>

<h4 id="address-type-identification">Address Type Identification</h4>
<p>| <strong>Address Type</strong>      | <strong>Binary Prefic</strong> | <strong>IPv6 notation</strong> |
| Unspecified  | 00…0 (128 bits) | ::/128 |
| Loopback | 00…1 (128 bits) | ::1/128 |
| Multicast | 11111111 | FF00::/8 |
| Link-local Unicast | 1111111010 | FE80::/10 |
| Unique-local Unicast | 11111100 | FC000::/10 |</p>

<p>Global unicast addresses are everything else.</p>

      <p>IPv6 is a 128-bit address compared to IPv4 32-bit address. It is represented as 8 16-bit fields separated by colons. Since these 16-bit fields are written in hex, it is 8 four-digit hex values. A couple of rules exist to shorten the address:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>leading</em> 0’s of any 16-bit field can be eliminated :00FF can become :FF</li>
  <li>any single contiguous string of one or more 16-bit segments consisting of all 0’s can be shortened with a double colon - FE80:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001 becomes FE80::1
    <ul>
      <li>however only one double colon is allowed to exist in any address.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Within an IPv6 address, each hexadecimal number represents 4 bits. For example F represents 1111 and 8 represents 1000. IPv6 address format makes it very clear that an address is not something numerical, it is a bit string versus a numerical number. IPv4 often fools people into thinking the address is something that can be quantified when it cannot.</p>

<p>IPv6 prefixes are always identified with a bitcount. 3ffe:1944:100:a::bc:2500:d0b/64 for example. When you are writing just the prefix, you set the host bits to all 0’s just as you would with an IPv4 address - 3ffe:1944:100:a::/64 would be the prefix of the address above.</p>

<p>On Cisco routers, IPv6 routing has to be specifically enabled using the global configuration command <strong>ipv6 unicast routing</strong>. If a router is configured with IPv6 addresses, but IPv6 is not enabled using the <strong>ipv6 unicast routing</strong> command, then the router is essentially acting as an IPv6 host.</p>

        Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2017</span>

    <a href="/blog/tags/#knowledge" class="post-tag">knowledge</a>
    
    

    <article>
      <p>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is a protocol that is able to detect link failures within milliseconds or even microseconds between two adjacent routers. Most of the routing protocols have some mechanism to detect down links. OSPF has hello packets and the dead interval, EIGRP uses hello packets and a holddown timer, etc. Unfortunately since these mechanisms depend on the control plane, they are not very fast at determining a failure has occurred. But networks that support real-time traffic such as VoIP require fast convergence times. The closest comparison is reducing timer mechanisms of the routing protocols, but BFD is still faster in every situation.</p>

<p>BFD was designed to be fast. Its packets can be processed by some interface modules or line cards so there isn’t much overhead. BFD runs independent of routing protocols, but once it is up you can configure the routing protocols to use BFD for link failure detection instead of their own mechanisms. BFD operates in the forwarding place as compared to the control plane mechanisms of routing protocols.</p>

<p>BFD has two operating modes, asynchronous and demand modes. The asynchronous mode is similar to the hello and holddown timers where BFD will keep sending hello packets (called BFD control packets) and when you don’t receive some of them, the session is torn down. Right now, no vendors support demand mode which relies on polling. Asynchronous mode requires that BFD be enabled and operational on both sides of the link.</p>

<p>In the Cisco implementation, there is one BFD process that runs, regardless of the number of Layer 3 routing protocols that are dependent upon it. Cisco BED also requires CEF to be enabled.</p>

<p>Both modes support <strong>echo mode</strong>. When a device sends BFD echo packets along the forwarding path, the BFD session at the other end does not participate in the actual forwarding of the echo packets. This reduces the number of control packets that have to be sent out and also may slightly increase the link failure detection time as no processing has to occur at the remote end. BFD echo mode is enabled by default.</p>

<p>You first enable BDF on an interface as below.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>`R1(conf)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(conf-if)# bfs interval *milliseconds* `min_rx` *milliseconds* multiplier *interval-multiplier*
R1(conf-if)# end
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>`Really BFD by itself is not useful. You must enable another client or protocol to use BFD for link failure notification for BFD to be of any use. Optional protocols include OSPF, EIGRP, BGP, IS-IS, and HSRP.</p>

<h4 id="bgp">BGP</h4>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>`R1(config)# router bgp 2828
R1(config-router)# neighbor 27.143.12.88 **fall-over bfd**
R1(config-router)# end
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">#### EIGRP
R1(config)# router eigrp 100
R1(config)# log-adjacency-changes
R1(config-router)# bfd all-interfaces **or**
R1(config-router)# bfd interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-router)# end
</code>``
`#### OSPF
There are two methods for enabling BFD support for OSPF:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can enable BFD for all interfaces for which OSPF is routing by using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">bfd all-interfaces</code> command in router configuration mode. You can then disable BFD support on individual interfaces using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ip ospf bfd disable</code> command.</li>
  <li>You can enable BFD on a per interface basis with <code class="highlighter-rouge">ip ospf bfd</code> command in interface configuration mode.
    <h4 id="hsrp">HSRP</h4>
    <p>You enable bfd to register with HSRP by issuing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">standby bfd</code> interface command or by issuing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">standby bfd all-interfaces</code> command in global configuration mode.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

      <p>By default, a Cisco router will run using one global routing and forwarding table. VRF Lite gives us the ability to virtualize the physical router into logical routers with their own independent IP routing tables. You can designate interfaces or sub interfaces to be associated with a particular VRF.</p>

<p>Here is a simple VRF configuration.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>`R1(config)# ip vrf red
R1(config-vrf)# exit
R1(config)# ip vrf blue
R1(config-vrf)# exit
R1(config)# interface FastEthernet0/0
R1(config-if)# ip vrf forwarding Blue
R1(config-if)# exit
R1(config)# interface FastEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# ip vrf forwarding Red
R1(config-if)# exit
R1(config)# router ospf 1 vrf Blue
R1(config-router)# network 192.168.0.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
R1(config-router)# exit
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>`
To use ping, you will have to remember to specify the VRF or else the router will use the global routing table.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>`ping vrf Blue 1.1.1.1
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>`</p>
