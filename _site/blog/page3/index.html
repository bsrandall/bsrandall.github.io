      <p>RIP exchanges UDP encapsulated packets over UDP port 520. RIP has two message types:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Request messages</strong> are used to ask neighboring routers to send an update</li>
  <li><strong>Response message</strong> carries the actual update</li>
</ul>

<p>When a RIP router process starts, it broadcasts a Request message out <em>each</em> RIP-enabled interface. The begins the state machine with neighbors receiving a RIP request and responding with a RIP Response.</p>

<p>When the requesting router receives the Response message, it processes the enclosed information and responds in one of 3 ways, depending on the information in the RIP Response.</p>
<ol>
  <li>If a route in the Response is new, it is entered into the route table along with the address of the advertising router.</li>
  <li>If there is a route for a network that RIP has already entered into the table and the new route has a lower metric (hop count), then the new route will replace the old route.</li>
  <li>If there is a route for a network that RIP has already entered into the table and the new route has a higher hop count and the update was originated by the recorded next-hop router, the router will be marked as unreachable for a specified holddown period. If the same neighbor is still advertising the higher hop count at the end of the holddown timer, the routing table is updated with the new metric.</li>
</ol>

<p>RIP does not store information received in a Topology table, nor do routers have a picture of the entire topology. They receive routes in Response messages, process the information in those messages, and then move on. The RIP Response messages contain that router’s full routing table, with the exception of routes that are stressed by the split-horizon rule.</p>

<p>Route Summarization means there are no routes for child addresses in the RIP routing table, reducing the size of the table and allowing the router to handle more routes. Summary IP address functions more efficiently than multiple individual advertised IP routes for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The summarized routes in the Rip database are processed first</li>
  <li>Any associated child routes that are included in a summarized route are skipped as RIP looks through the routing database, reducing the processing time required.</li>
</ul>

<p>If auto-summary is enabled, as soon as RIP determines a summary address is required in the RIP database, a summary entry is created in the RIP routing database. As long as there are child routes for a summary address, the address remains in the routing database.</p>

<p>RIPv2 route summarization requires that the lowest metric of an aggregated entry, or the lowest metric of all child routes, be advertised.</p>

<p><strong>show ip protocols</strong> command will verify which routes are summarized for an interface.</p>

      <p>Stateless Address Autoconfiguration is a mechanism that allows a host to generate its own unicast address using a combination of locally available information and information advertised by routers. Here are the 4 steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The host creates its own link-local unicast address by appending a randomly generated or EUI-64 created Interface ID to FE80::/10.</li>
  <li>The host performs Duplicate Address Detection on its newly created link-local address.</li>
  <li>The host (if it hasn’t already received one), sends a Router Solicitation message. The Router Advertisement includes the prefix, prefix length, and link MTU. The host uses this information along with its self created Interface ID to create its global unicast address. The default gateway is the Router’s link-local address.</li>
  <li>The host performs Duplicate Address Detection on its global unicast address before using.</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition to SLAAC, there is also DHCPv6, which is a stateful process. Whether a host that is configured to obtain its addressing information automatically uses SLAAC or DHCPv6 depends upon the configuration of the router’s Router Advertisement message.</p>

    <article>
      <p>EUI-64 is an IEEE defined process where EUI stands for Extended Unique Identifier. The EUI-64 process enables automatic Interface ID (host portion) creation. It uses the interface’s Ethernet MAC address to generate a 64-bit interface ID. The idea behind it is that a MAC address is globally unique, so combined with Router Advertisements providing prefix and prefix length, a device can self assign its IP address. The steps of EUI-64 address creation are outlined below.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The MAC address is split in the middle with 24 bits on the left and 24 bits on the right.</li>
  <li>FFFE is inserted between the 24 bits.</li>
  <li>The seventh bit is inverted (if it is 0 it becomes 1 and vice versa). The hexadecimal value (since it is the 7th bit or 2nd bit from the right) will go from 0 to 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is an example of how to configure an EUI-64 address on an interface.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>`R1(config)# interface gig0/1
R1(config-if)# ipv6 address ipv6-prefix/prefix-length **eui-64**
R1(config-if)# end
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>`
There are some privacy concerns relating to using a device’s MAC address to generate its Layer 3 address. Because of this, many vendors have replaced the EUI-64 process with a random process to generate the Interface ID.</p>

        IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol

      <p>Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) is used by IPv6 hosts and routers for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)</li>
  <li>Duplicate Address Detection</li>
  <li>for Layer-2 Data-Link address resolution (similar to IPv4 ARP)</li>
  <li>to determine if neighbors are reachable (Neighbor Unreachability Detection)</li>
  <li>when a router fails, a host actively searches for functioning alternates.</li>
</ul>

<p>Neighbor Discovery uses 5 ICMPv6 messages:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Router Solicitation message</li>
  <li>Router Advertisement message</li>
  <li>Neighbor Solicitation message</li>
  <li>Neighbor Advertisement message</li>
  <li>Redirect message</li>
</ol>

<p>Router Solicitation messages are used by hosts when it needs prefix, prefix length, default gateway, and other information for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC). Router Advertisement messages are the messages used by Routers to convey that information to hosts.</p>

<p>Neighbor Solicitation and Neighbor Advertisement messages are two more protocols that use ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery. These messages are used by a device to request Layer 2 link layer address information from another device on the same network or to provide this information to the requesting device. Neighbor Solicitation and Neighbor Advertisement messages are part of three important processes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Address resolution</li>
  <li>Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)</li>
  <li>Neighbor Unreachability Detection (DUD)</li>
</ol>

<p>An IPv6 host will maintain two tables for each interface:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Neighbor cache</li>
  <li>Destination Cache</li>
</ul>

<p>The Neighbor cache is equivalent to an ARP table in IPv4. The neighbor cache contains mappings of hosts on the same network, while the destination cache contains layer-2 to layer-3 resolutions for devices on other links or networks.  To see the Neighbor table, issue <code class="highlighter-rouge">show ipv6 neighbors</code> command.</p>

      <p>There are 3 types of IPv6 addresses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unicast</li>
  <li>Anycast</li>
  <li>Multicast</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no “broadcast” type as in IPv4, but an “all nodes” multicast address does exist, which essentially serves the same purpose.</p>
<h4 id="unicast">Unicast</h4>
<p>A unicast address is an address that identifies a single device. A <em>global</em> unicast address is one that is assigned to a single host and is globally unique. These are the equivalent of a routable IPv4 address.
<a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/i/300001-400000/330001-340000/330001-331000/330523.tif/_jcr_content/renditions/330523.jpg">link</a>
The host portion of the address is called the Interface ID. This is a more accurate description as a host can have more than one address (as can an interface, but often not).</p>

<p>IPv6 addresses, unlike IPv4 addresses, have the subnet bits built in as part of the network portion of the address. In IPv4, the subnet bits were borrowed from the host portion. One benefit from this is that the Interface ID can be a consistent length for all IPv6 addresses, simplifying parsing of the address. The Interface ID, with very few exceptions, is 64 bits long. Also, with very few exceptions, the Subnet ID field is 16 bits long, providing for 65,636 separate subnets. This leaves 48 bits for the Global Routing Prefix of the address.</p>

<p>The currently allocated IPv6 global unicast addresses are 2xxx::/4 through 3xxx::/4. The most common allocation is a /48 global routing prefix, a 16-bit subnet ID, and a 64 bit Interface ID.</p>

<p>IPv6 also has <em>link-local</em> unicast address in addition to the global unicast address type. The difference is that a link-local address’ scope is limited to a single link, and its uniqueness in not guaranteed outside of that link. The first 10 bits are always FE80 (1111111010). Link-local addresses have great utility for functions like Neighbor Discovery Protocol and Address Autoconfiguration. They are similar to the 169.254.0.0/16 in IPv4. Link local addresses are never routable. Below is an example configuration in which you will see a subnet is not even declared.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>`R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# ipv6 address FE80::1 link-local
R1config-if)# exit
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>`Link-local addresses are significant only within a single link. Packets with link-local sources or destinations are mostly used by the router’s control plane protocols, such as IPv6 routing protocols.</p>

<p>There is also <em>unique-local</em> IPv6 addresses. These are equivalent to IPv4 RFC1918 addresses. They are likely unique, but not routable via global BGP. Thee always start with FC00::/7.</p>

<h4 id="anycast">Anycast</h4>
<p>An any cast address really represents more of a service than an address. An any cast address can reside on multiple hosts. Routers do not know they reside on different hosts but assume that they have multiple routes to the same host, so a single router simply choses the route to which it has the lowest cost route. Anycast also offers reliable backup, for if a single device goes down, routers will just route to the next lowest-cost available server. There are some reserved Anycast addresses, but for most services, an anycast address is just a global unicast address providing the any cast service.</p>

<h4 id="multicast">Multicast</h4>
<p>A multicast address identifies a set of devices - a <em>multicast group</em>. The first 8 bits of a multicast address are always 1s (FF00). The next 4 bits are the Flags. The following 4 bits are the Scope. Finally, the last 112 bits represent the Group ID.</p>

<h4 id="address-type-identification">Address Type Identification</h4>
<p>| <strong>Address Type</strong>      | <strong>Binary Prefic</strong> | <strong>IPv6 notation</strong> |
| Unspecified  | 00…0 (128 bits) | ::/128 |
| Loopback | 00…1 (128 bits) | ::1/128 |
| Multicast | 11111111 | FF00::/8 |
| Link-local Unicast | 1111111010 | FE80::/10 |
| Unique-local Unicast | 11111100 | FC000::/10 |</p>

<p>Global unicast addresses are everything else.</p>
