  <h1 class="page-title">3.4.1.1.1 - Enabling RIP</h1>
  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>R1(config)#router rip
R1(config-router)#network 192.168.12.0
R1(config-router)#network 172.16.1.0
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Above is a basic RIP configuration on R1.  The <strong>network</strong> command in RIP does 2 things.</p>
<ol>
  <li>All networks that fall in the range of the network command will be advertised in RIP to other routers, if the router contains routes to that range of networks.</li>
  <li>RIP Updates will be sent on the interface that falls in the range of the network command.</li>
</ol>

<p>Only two steps are needed to configure RIP.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Enable RIP with the global configuration command <code class="highlighter-rouge">router rip</code></li>
  <li>Specify each major network on which to run RIP with the <strong>network</strong> command.</li>
</ol>

<p>RIP exchanges UDP encapsulated packets over UDP port 520. RIP has two message types:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Request messages</strong> are used to ask neighboring routers to send an update</li>
  <li><strong>Response message</strong> carries the actual update</li>
</ul>

<p>When a RIP router process starts, it broadcasts a Request message out <em>each</em> RIP-enabled interface. The begins the state machine with neighbors receiving a RIP request and responding with a RIP Response.</p>

<p>When the requesting router receives the Response message, it processes the enclosed information and responds in one of 3 ways, depending on the information in the RIP Response.</p>
<ol>
  <li>If a route in the Response is new, it is entered into the route table along with the address of the advertising router.</li>
  <li>If there is a route for a network that RIP has already entered into the table and the new route has a lower metric (hop count), then the new route will replace the old route.</li>
  <li>If there is a route for a network that RIP has already entered into the table and the new route has a higher hop count and the update was originated by the recorded next-hop router, the router will be marked as unreachable for a specified holddown period. If the same neighbor is still advertising the higher hop count at the end of the holddown timer, the routing table is updated with the new metric.</li>
</ol>

<p>RIP does not store information received in a Topology table, nor do routers have a picture of the entire topology. They receive routes in Response messages, process the information in those messages, and then move on. The RIP Response messages contain that router’s full routing table, with the exception of routes that are stressed by the split-horizon rule.</p>

<p>Another configuration issue is that RIPv1 does not support discontiguous networks. Discontiguous networks arise when a major network is separated by a major network. The problem arises because RIP summarizes at the major network boundary. This summarization is done at the classful boundary. If there is one major network between the two discontiguous networks, the RIP routers will receive a summarized route they already have in their routing table, so they will silently drop it. The result is that only half the of the discontiguous network is reachable. If there are two major networks between, then each major network believes it has a route to the summarized network, so they will install two equal-cost routes to the discontiguous network. This again would result in only half the communication being received by the destination network.</p>

<p>The workarounds for discontiguous networks with RIP would be to install static routes for the individual networks. The other solution is to apply secondary IPs to the interfaces of the in-between major network. These IPs would be from the summarized discontiguous network in question. The RIP routing process sees secondary addresses as separate data links.</p>

<h4 id="ripv2">RIPv2</h4>
<p>RIPv2 is defined in RFC 1723. It is not a new protocol, but rather just RIPv1 with some extensions bringing it more up to date with modern routing environments. The improvements include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>subnet masks carried with each route entry</li>
  <li>authentication of routing updates</li>
  <li>next-hop addresses carried with each route entry</li>
  <li>external route tags</li>
  <li>multicast route updates</li>
</ul>

<p>Operation of RIPv2 is similar to RIPv1, and all the timer mechanisms remain the same. One difference is that updates are sent to the multicast address 224.0.0.9 instead of the broadcast address 255.255.255.255 that RIPv1 used.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/ripv2-message-format.png" alt="RIPv2 Message Format" /></p>

<p>The RIPv2 message format is similar to RIPv1.</p>

<p><strong>Command</strong> is set to 1 for a request message or 2 for a response message.</p>

<p><strong>Version</strong> will be 2 for RIPv2. Note that RIPv2 will process valid RIPv1 messages.</p>

<p><strong>Address Family Identifier</strong> is set to 2 for IPv4. The only exception is a request for a router’s full routing table, in which case it will be 0.</p>

<p><strong>Route tag</strong> provides a field for tagging external routes or routes that have been distributed into the RIPv2 process. One possible use is to carry the AS number of of routes that have been imported into RIP. This might be needed in case the information is carried across the RIP domain and then shared back with the external routing protocol in another location.</p>

<p><strong>IP Address</strong> is the IPv4 address of the destination of the route. It may be a major network address, a subnet, or a host.</p>

<p><strong>Subnet Mask</strong> is a 32 bit mask that identifies the host and network portions of the IPv4 address.</p>

<p><strong>Next Hop</strong> identifies a better next-hop address, if one exists, than the address of the advertising router. It will be populated if there is another router on the same subnet that is closer to the destination than the advertising router. If the field is set to 0.0.0.0, then the advertising router is the best next-hop address.</p>

<p><strong>Metric</strong> is the hop count, between 1 and 16.</p>

<p>As RIPv2 is a classless routing protocol, when it goes to look up a destination in the routing table, it does not pay attention to the class of the destination address. Instead, it performs a bit-by-bit best match between the destination address and all of its known routes.</p>

<p>One interesting note in regards to all classless routing protocols - Cisco IOS rejects an attempt to configure an all-zeroes subnet. To override this enter the global configuration command <strong>ip subnet-zero</strong></p>

<p>We saw with RIPv1 that discontiguous subnets could be a problem. Classless routing protocols do not have the same issue, as each route update contains a mask, so subnets of one major network can be advertised into another major network. But the default behavior of RIPv2 is to summarize at network boundaries just like RIPv1. To turn off this summarization and allow subnets to be advertised across network boundaries, use the command <strong>no auto-summary</strong> in the RIP router configuration mode.</p>
