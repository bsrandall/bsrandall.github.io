Note that this was moved to be a written only topic. So my coverage will be small and simple as can be for a very deep technology.

Performance Routing (PfR), previously called Optimized Edge Routing (OER), introduces a new concept into IP routing. With traditional routing, path selection decisions do not consider a particular path’s traffic characteristics be it throughput, actual delay, packet loss, voice mean opinion score (MOS), monetary cost of a given path, or jitter. PfR enhances the classic destination-based routing concept centered on the shortest path (lowest-cost metric) by adding into the routing selection process, network performance and/or application performance aware intelligence.

In the past, router’s simply did not have the physical resources to be able to route based on anything other than a simple metric. With the memory and CPU available in today’s routers, not routing based on advanced metrics is a waste of resources.

Let’s say we have two links to the internet as shown above. The current situation is we have the T1 configured to be a backup circuit to the Ethernet circuit in case the Ethernet circuit goes down. In our PfR example, we will show how to use the T1 link when the Ethernet link hits 75% saturation. In our scenario, PfR will will automatically use NetFlow, the interface’s utilization, along with active probing with IP SLA to determine the availability of an alternate path. Knowledge of NetFlow and IP SLA is not needed as PfR manages the configuration of these technologies.

Central to PfR is the concept of a Master Controller (MC) and Border Routers (BR). The MC is the centralized decision maker and is responsible for controlling the Bfs and acting as a central location to store and analyze data collected from the BRs. The MC does not need to be in the path of traffic flows but does need basic IP reachability to the BRs. The communication between the MC and BRs occurs over an authenticated TCP connection on port 3949 by default. The BR is responsible for initiating the TCP connection. The authentication is handled via key chains like we saw in RIP and EIGRP. The MC and the BR can be the same router, for lab or small networks.

Let’s jump into the configuration. First we will set up the BR and tell it where it can find the MC, as well as provide the key chain used to authenticate. The older IOS versions use **oer** while the new IOS versions (\>15.0) use **pfr** commands.
```
`R3(config)#oer border
R3(config-oer-br)#local Loopback0
R3(config-oer-br)#master 150.1.3.3 key-chain OER R3(config-oer-br)#exit
```
`On the MC there is a little more configuration. We need to define the BR(s) as well as the internal and external interfaces. There must be at least 1 internal and 2 external interfaces in the PfR domain.
```
`R3(config)#oer master
R3(config-oer-mc)#border 150.1.3.3 key-chain OER
R3(config-oer-mc-br)#interface FastEthernet0/0 internal
R3(config-oer-mc-br)#interface Serial1/0.1 external
R3(config-oer-mc-br-if)#interface FastEthernet0/1 external
R3(config-oer-mc-br-if)#exit
```
`
In order to see the status, use the following.
```
`R1# show her master
```
`
Now, to tell the MC to start monitoring the Ethernet’s throughput rate so that traffic can be offloaded to the T1 once the 75% threshold has been reached, we have to enter the **learn** sub configuration mode on the MC.
```
`R3(config-oer-mc)#learn
R3(config-oer-mc-learn)#throughput
```
`The default interface utilization threshold is 75% when monitoring throughput. This can be changed under the interface configuration sub-mode for a particular BR.

*Traffic classes* are used in PfR to designate types of traffic out of the traffic flow that we want to manipulate. The MC will learn up to 100 of these traffic classes by default. This can be changed using the **prefixes \<1-100000\>** command.Initially PfR only supported Layer 3 prefixes, but now it can learn traffic classes from Layer 4 ports or DSCP as well. For our example we will use layer 3 prefixes. PfR aggregates traffic flows into /24 prefixes by default before sending the information to the MC. We can change that in the learn configuration sub-mode with the **aggregation-type prefix-length \<1-32\>** command. We will do some final configuration on the MC. We will need to change the MC’s route control policy settings from observe (mode route observe) to route control (mode route control) so that the MC can instruct the BR to inject static routes allowing it to move traffic from the Ethernet link to the T1 link.
```
`R3(config)#oer master
R3(config-oer-mc)#mode route control
```
`
Now you may wonder how PfR knew to route to the T1 when the load hit 75%. Well there is no magic. The only way this would happen is if we have a secondary route to the same destination. In our example, we had a floating static route configured.
```
`ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.10.1.1
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.10.2.1 5
```
`Without the second route, PfR would not have sent traffic across the Serial link, even after the Ethernet circuit hit 75% utilization. PfR calls these additional routes*parent routes*. They do not have to be installed in the routing table, they just have to be available in the configuration.parent
