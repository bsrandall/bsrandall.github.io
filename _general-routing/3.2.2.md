Unique-local addresses are one of the types of IPv6 unicast addresses. The address space is FC00:: - FD00::/8. Currently FC00::/8 is not being used. These are similar to IPv4 RFC1918 addresses in that they are not globally routable. These should not be used, though, like RFC1918 addresses - there simply isn’t the need to number internal hosts with non-routable addresses in IPv6. Heck, that is part of the whole reason why IPv6 was created!

The real way these should be deployed is in situations where the hosts *never* want to talk to the internet. Lab situations or high security deployments should be your first thought.

Cisco’s documentation is a little more lenient. They say:
- it has a globally unique prefix
- if it is accidentally leaked outside a site via routing or DNS, there is no conflict with any other addresses
- since interfaces can support multiple IPv6 address types, unique local and global addresses can be used
- global addresses should be used if Internet connectivity is desired
