Two-way multipoint redistribution can introduce routing loops in the network. One option to prevent redistribution of already redistributed routes is to use route tagging. In two-way multipoint redistribution scenarios, route tags must be applied and filtered in both direction and on both routers performing redistribution.

This would be a configuration to filter routes based on tags.
```
`HULL(config)#route-map EIGRPtoOSPF deny 10
HULL(config-route-map)#match tag 11
HULL(config-route-map)#route-map EIGRPtoOSPF permit 20
HULL(config-route-map)#set tag 22

HULL(config-route-map)#route-map OSPFtoEIGRP deny 10
HULL(config-route-map)#match tag 22
HULL(config-route-map)#route-map OSPFtoEIGRP permit 20
HULL(config-route-map)#set tag 11

HULL(config-route-map)#router ospf 11
HULL(config-router)#redistribute eigrp 22 subnets route-map EIGRPtoOSPF

HULL(config-router)#router eigrp 22
HULL(config-router)#redistribute ospf 11 metric 1500 1 255 1 1500 route-map OSPFtoEIGRP
```
`
The result is that we ensure that only routes originating in the OSPF domain are redistributed into EIGRP, while only routes originating in the EIGRP domain are redistributed into OSPF.

The same configuration would need to be set on the WENDOVER router in our example.
