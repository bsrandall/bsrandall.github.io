#### Access Lists
```
`Router(config-ipv6-acl)# deny ipv6 2001:db8:0:12::/64 any
```
`You can see above that one big difference with IPv6 access lists is that there is no longer a wildcard ,all. The IPv6 subnet is easily declared in CIDR notation.

In IPv4 if we were applying access list 1 to an interface, we would do so with the **ip access-group 1** command. With IPv6, that command has been replaced with **ipv6 traffic-filter**.
```
`Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
Router(config-if)# ipv6 traffic-filter 1
```
`
