EUI-64 is an IEEE defined process where EUI stands for Extended Unique Identifier. The EUI-64 process enables automatic Interface ID (host portion) creation. It uses the interface’s Ethernet MAC address to generate a 64-bit interface ID. The idea behind it is that a MAC address is globally unique, so combined with Router Advertisements providing prefix and prefix length, a device can self assign its IP address. The steps of EUI-64 address creation are outlined below.
1. The MAC address is split in the middle with 24 bits on the left and 24 bits on the right.
2. FFFE is inserted between the 24 bits.
3. The seventh bit is inverted (if it is 0 it becomes 1 and vice versa). The hexadecimal value (since it is the 7th bit or 2nd bit from the right) will go from 0 to 2.

Here is an example of how to configure an EUI-64 address on an interface.
```
`R1(config)# interface gig0/1
R1(config-if)# ipv6 address ipv6-prefix/prefix-length **eui-64**
R1(config-if)# end
```

There are some privacy concerns relating to using a device’s MAC address to generate its Layer 3 address. Because of this, many vendors have replaced the EUI-64 process with a random process to generate the Interface ID.
