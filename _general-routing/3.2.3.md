Global Aggregate is just a long-hand version of *global unicast* addressing. It is an IPv6 address from the aggregatable global unicast prefix. There is a strict assignment for these addresses in order to limit the number of routing table entries in the global routing table.

![global unicast format][1]

A *global* unicast address is one that is assigned to a single host and is globally unique. These are the equivalent of a routable IPv4 address.
The host portion of the address is called the Interface ID. This is a more accurate description as a host can have more than one address (as can an interface, but often not).

IPv6 addresses, unlike IPv4 addresses, have the subnet bits built in as part of the network portion of the address. In IPv4, the subnet bits were borrowed from the host portion. One benefit from this is that the Interface ID can be a consistent length for all IPv6 addresses, simplifying parsing of the address. The Interface ID, with very few exceptions, is 64 bits long. Also, with very few exceptions, the Subnet ID field is 16 bits long, providing for 65,636 separate subnets. This leaves 48 bits for the Global Routing Prefix of the address.

The currently allocated IPv6 global unicast addresses are 2xxx::/4 through 3xxx::/4. The most common allocation is a /48 global routing prefix, a 16-bit subnet ID, and a 64 bit Interface ID.
