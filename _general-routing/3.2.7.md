IPv6 route redistribution allows routes to be specified by prefix, using a route-map prefix list, or by tag, using the route-map “match tag” function.

One noticeable difference between IPv4 and IPv6 protocol independent route redistribution involves connected routes. In IPv4, routes as shown by routing table are redistributed. Also, connected address which routing protocols enable is redistributed. However in IPv6, routes as shown by routing table are redistributed. But, unlike IPv4, connected address which routing protocols enable is NOT redistributed by default. You use `R1(config-router)# redistribute rip 1 include-connected`if you’d like to redistribute connected address. Using **redistribute connected** can redistribute connected address, but non-related connected address are also redistributed.

`R1(config-router)# redistribute rip 1 
R1(config-router)# redistribute connected
