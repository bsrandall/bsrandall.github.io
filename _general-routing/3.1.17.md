A GRE Tunnel is an encapsulated tunnel between two devices that makes the connection act like a point-to-point interface. We are essentially putting packets inside packets; in other words, we are encapsulating the IP packets into GRE packets.

[link][1]
We will use the above figure to create a sample tunnel between the HQ and Branch routers.
```
`HQ(config)#interface tunnel 1     
HQ(config-if)#tunnel source fastEthernet 0/0
HQ(config-if)#tunnel destination 192.168.23.3
HQ(config-if)#ip address 192.168.13.1 255.255.255.0
```
\`\`\`\`
\`Branch(config)#interface tunnel 1
Branch(config-if)#tunnel source fastEthernet 0/0
Branch(config-if)#tunnel destination 192.168.12.1
Branch(config-if)#ip address 192.168.13.3 255.255.255.0
```
`
The default tunneling mode is GRE so it is not required to set it explicitly in this case.

Notice we are setting the destination address to be the outside interface that is reachable over the un-encapsulated network. You can also use loopback addresses.

Some options that GRE tunneling supports are:
- add an additional checksum
- specify a tunnel key
- enforce packet sequencing

Those options are seen under the **tunnel** subcommand in interface configuration mode.
```
