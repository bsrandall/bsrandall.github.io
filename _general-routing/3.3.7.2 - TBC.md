A router running a distance-vector protocol advertises routes based on what is in its route table. As a result, a route filter will influence which routes the router advertises to its neighbors.

Routers running link-state protocols determine their routes based on information in their link-state database, rather than the advertised route entries of their neighbors. Route filters have no effect on link- state advertisements or the link-state database. As a result, a route filter can influence the route table of the router on which the filter is configured but has no effect on the route entries of neighboring routers. Because of this behavior, route filters are used mostly at redistribution points into link-state domains, such as an OSPF ASBR (autonomous system boundary router), where they can regulate which routes enter or leave the domain. Within the link-state domain, route filters have limited utility.
