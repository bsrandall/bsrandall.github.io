Passive interfaces are used to limit an interfaces activity within a dynamic routing protocol. For all dynamic routing protocols, when you declare an interface to be passive, that interface will no longer send hello packets or routing updates out of that interface. You can declare passive interfaces globally and then exclude the active interfaces with **no passive-interface**.

With RIP, if you declare an interface as a passive interface, that interface will no longer send routing updates. However, the interface does still listen to routing updates that are multicast to its interface.

With EIGRP and OSPF, declaring an interface as passive prevents that interface from sending Hello packets. Therefore no neighbor relationships will be formed and thus no routing updates will be sent or received by the interface.

Configuration of passive-interface with all 3 IGPs is similar.
```
`R1(config)# router rip | eigrp | ospf
R1(config-router)# passive-interface FastEthernet0/1
```
\`And the configuration for make all interfaces passive by default is the same across all 3 IGPs as well.
\`\`\`
\`R1(config)# router rip | eigrp | ospf
R1(config-router)# passive-interface default
R1(config-router)# no passive-interface FastEthernet0/0
