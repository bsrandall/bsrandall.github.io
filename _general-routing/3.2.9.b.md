This is not a topic that was on the INE v5 blueprint. I am including it here as NAT64 is the replacement for NAT-PT. NAT64 is not to be confused with IPv6 6in4 Tunneling.

NAT64 is a service that is used by IPv6 hosts to communicate with IPv4 servers. Like NAT-PT, NAT64 also calls for a router to have interfaces on both IPv4 and IPv6 networks, and for that router to do translations between addresses on each network. In reality, it is used for IPv6 client to IPv4 server communication only. The reverse path is pretty much useless (NAT46), as it is for NAT44 PAT.

An IPv6 prefix is dedicated to mapped IPv4 addresses.

DNS64 converts A records into AAAA records using the NAT64 prefix above and serves A and AAAA records to the client.

The NAT64 router then advertises the NAT64 prefix into the IPv6 network to attract traffic towards the IPv4 servers. If you are a host running on the IPv6-only network, there is an easy way to detect the IPv6 prefix used for NAT64 - do a AAAA DNS lookup for ip4only.arpa, and extract the NAT64 prefix from the response.

There is both a stateful and stateless version of NAT64. The stateful version is very similar to PAT (stateful NAT44).  Individual TCP and UDP sessions are translated. In stateless NAT64, each IPv6 address is translated into one IPv4 address, so in reality this has very limited use, perhaps only for IPv6 servers.

First things first, R2 will need to have IPv6 routing enabled, or nothing will work.
```
`R2(config)#ipv6 unicast-routing
```
\`The next step is to enable NAT64 on the respective interfaces.
```
`R2(config)#interface FastEthernet 0/0
R2(config-if)#nat64 enable
```
````
`R2(config)#interface FastEthernet 1/0
R2(config-if)#nat64 enable 
```
`IANA has allocated prefix 64:FF9B::/96 for NAT64 translations. When R2 receives anything that starts with this prefix, then it will be processed by NAT64. You can also use your own prefix.
```
`R2(config)#nat64 prefix stateful 64:FF9B::/96
```
`We can then configure the actual translation rule:
```
`R2(config)#nat64 v6v4 static 2001:DB8:2323:2323::3 192.168.12.3
```
`Some show commands are available for us to verify operation.
