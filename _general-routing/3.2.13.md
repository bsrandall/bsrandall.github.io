ISATAP was designed to help IP4-only devices communicate to native IPv6 devices, so its origin is the opposite of the other IPv6 tunneling techniques.

![link][1]

Notice in the diagram below we have an IPv4 host attached to an IPv4 router. The Host needs to communicate with an IPv6 Host (in this case the router). ISATAP involves dynamic tunneling from the Host to the ISATAP Router (Router A).

It is a creative solution in its operation. The networks DNS server is updated with a well-known entry of ISATAP that resolves to the IPv4 address used in the tunnel on the ISATAP router (RouterA). Host A initializes and sends a request to the DNS server for the address associates with “ISATAP”. The DNS server sends a reply with the IPv4 address of the ISATAP router. Host A tunnels a router discovery packet (using an IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulation) and sends this packet to the ISATAP router. The ISATAP router responds with a Router Advertisement that includes the IPv6 prefix the host should use. The ISATAP Host takes this prefix, concatenates it with 0000:fEFE, concatenated with its own IPv4 address in order to form its ISATAP IPv6 address, Now the host is able to fully communicate beyond its local network using IPv6 and ISATAP.

| 64 bits | 32 bits | 32 bits |
| link local or global IPv6 unicast prefix | 0000:5EFE | IPv4 address of the ISATAP link |

Above is the format of the ISATAP address. Below is a sample configuration of the ISATAP router.
```
`RouterA:
configure terminal
!
interface Tunnel 0
ip address 2001:80f0:4:300::/64 eui-64
no ipv6 nd suppress-ra
tunnel source 172.16.1.20
tunnel mode ipv6ip isatap
```
`The prefix assigned to the tunnel interface is the prefix that will be assigned to hosts. Notice the **no ipv6 nd suppress-ra** command is required to ensure that router advertisements are sent over the tunnel to hosts. By default, these messages are not used on tunnel interfaces.
