Stateless Address Autoconfiguration is a mechanism that allows a host to generate its own unicast address using a combination of locally available information and information advertised by routers. Here are the 4 steps:
1. The host creates its own link-local unicast address by appending a randomly generated or EUI-64 created Interface ID to FE80::/10.
2. The host performs Duplicate Address Detection on its newly created link-local address.
3. The host (if it hasn’t already received one), sends a Router Solicitation message. The Router Advertisement includes the prefix, prefix length, and link MTU. The host uses this information along with its self created Interface ID to create its global unicast address. The default gateway is the Router’s link-local address.
4. The host performs Duplicate Address Detection on its global unicast address before using.

In addition to SLAAC, there is also DHCPv6, which is a stateful process. Whether a host that is configured to obtain its addressing information automatically uses SLAAC or DHCPv6 depends upon the configuration of the router’s Router Advertisement message.
