All of the IGPS have the following in common when it comes to route summarization:
- the advertised summary is assigned the same metric as the currently lowest-,metric component subnet
- the router does not advertise the component subnets
- the router ceases advertising the summary when its routing tables does not have any of the component subnets
- the summarizing router creates a local route to the summary, with destination null0, to prevent routing loops
- summary routes reduce the size of the routing table and topology databases, indirectly improving convergence
- summary routes decrease the amount of specific information in routing tables, sometimes causing suboptimal routing
