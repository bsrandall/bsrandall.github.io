To block RIP broadcasts (or multicasts) on an interface connected to a subnet of a RIP-enabled network, add the `passive-interface gig0/1` command to the RIP process. The **passive-interface** command is not specific to RIP as it can be used with all routing protocols for this purpose.  This will only get the router to quit **sending** updates. If you want the router to not learn routes advertised across the interface, you must filter those updates.

The passive-interface command is often used in conjunction with the **neighbor** command to establish a unicast routing control plane.

You can use the passive interface command as a filtering mechanism. By enabling it on a routerâ€™s interface, you are filtering outbound routing updates sent out of that interface. 

```
`R1(config)# router rip
R1(config-router)# passive-interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-router)# network 192.168.1.0
R1(config-router)# exit
```
\`
You can also make passive interfaces the default and then enable on a per interface basis.
```
`R1(config)# router rip
R1(config-router)# passive-interface default
R1(config-router)# no passive-interface GigabitEthernet0/2
R1(config-router)# network 192.168.1.0
R1(config-router)# exit
```
\`
The **show ip interface** command will alert you if an interface is set to passive.
