Offset lists work in conjunction with *standard* access lists to change the metric of a route (hop count for RIP). It can be used for both inbound and outbound routes. The offset is a positive number which is added to the routeâ€™s metric either before it is sent or as it is received.
```
`R1(config)# router rip
R1(config-if)# offset-list 1 out 5
R1(config-if)# exit
!
R1(config)# access-list 1 permit 1.1.1.0 0.0.0.255
R1(config)# exit
```
\`The logic is that the permit allows the address specified to have the offset added to its metric.
