Administrative Distance can be used to filter out routes completely by setting the AD to 255. Distance can also be used to install a route into the routing table as either more preferable or less preferable. The format is **distance** followed by the AD, followed by the source of the prefix to filter (in address / wildcard format), followed by the access list number or name.

```
`R1(config)# router rip
R1(config-if)# distance 255 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 1
R1(config-if)# exit
!
R1(config)# access-list 1 permit 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.255
R1(config)# exit
```
\`
The example above would cause prefix 192.168.3.0/24 from any source to not be installed in the routing table. Always remember that RIP cannot advertise anything that is not in the routing table, so in this example, the route is completely filtered from being injected into the RIP domain from this particular router.
