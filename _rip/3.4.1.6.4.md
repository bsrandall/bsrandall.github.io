Extended access lists give you the added functionality of being able to filter routes by source - a standard access list only allows you to filter by prefix. The syntax is the “source” in the access list is the advertising router and the “destination” is the prefix you want filtered. Just like standard access lists, you must remember to PERMIT any at the end of your access list or at least remember that the default action will be to DENY.
```
`router rip
  version 2
  network 10.0.0.0
  network 192.168.1.0
  distribute-list 101 in
  no auto-summary
!
access-list 101 permit ip host 10.23.23.2 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
```
\`The extended access list above implemented with the distribute-list command will cause the router to only accept routes for the 192.168.1.0/24 prefix from 10.23.23.2.
