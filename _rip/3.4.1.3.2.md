If you disable auto-summary in RIP, you still have the ability to perform manual summarization. This is done in RIP on a per-interface basis with the **ip summary-address rip** command. It causes the router to summarize a given set of routes learned via RIPv2 or redistributed into RIPv2.
```
`R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-router)# ip summary-address 2.2.2.0 255.255.255.252
```
