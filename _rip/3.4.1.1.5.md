RIPv2 uses multicast by default for sending update packets. If for some reason you wish to change it to the default RIPv1 broadcast behavior, you can do this on a per-interface basis.
```
`R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
R1(config-if)# ip rip v2-broadcast
R1(config-if)# exit
```
\`The main reason to ever do this is if you needed to send updates to devices that did not listen to multicast broadcasts.

The RIP IP multicast address is 224.0.0.9.
