Standard access lists allow some basic route filtering to be accomplished. You cannot limit by source as you can with extended access lists, and you cannot limit by subnet as you can with prefix-lists. But if the purpose is simply to limit a route from being processed or sent, then a standard access list will do the job.

The logic is to DENY unwanted prefixes, so you must remember to place a PERMIT any as the last statement.
```
`router rip
  version 2
  network 10.0.0.0
  network 192.168.1.0
  distribute-list 1 in
  no auto-summary
!
access-list 1 deny 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.255
access-list 1 permit any
```
