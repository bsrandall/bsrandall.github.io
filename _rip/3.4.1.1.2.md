By default, a RIP process on  a Cisco router sends only RIPv1 messages but listens to both RIPv1 and RIPv2 messages. There are interface-level compatibility commands that should be utilized when working in an environment that uses both versions of RIP.
```
interface Ethernet0
 ip address 192.168.50.129 255.255.255.192
 ip rip send version 1
 ip rip receive version 1
!
interface Ethernet1
 ip address 172.25.150.193 255.255.255.240
 ip rip send version 1 2
!
interface Ethernet2
 ip address 172.25.150.225 255.255.255.240
!
router rip
 version 2
 network 172.25.0.0
 network 192.168.50.0
```
If you want the Router to default to RIPv2, then specify the version under the router rip configuration mode.
```
router rip
  version 2
```
