RIPv2 will normally multicast its entire routing table every 30 seconds by default. If no routes are changing, this can be very inefficient on slow links. On an interface, by interface basis, you can issue the command **ip rip triggered** which will force the routers on that interface to only exchange routes and updates when certain conditions arise. Those are:
- the router receives a specific request for a routing update (Full database is  sent)
- information from another interface modifies the routing table (Only last changes are sent)
- the interface comes up or goes down (Partial database is sent)
- the router is first powered on (Full database sent)

Entries learned from a triggered response are semi-permanent - they do not expire like other entries. Certain events can cause the route to timeout (such as the interface going down).
