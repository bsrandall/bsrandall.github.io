Prefix lists are used with the **distribute-list prefix** command to filter inbound or outbound routes. You permit or deny based on what you want to have happen to the route, so deny out would prevent updates being sent out regarding that prefix.
```
`R1(config)# router rip
R1(config-router)# distribute-list NO-R3 in FastEthernet0/0
R1(config-router)# exit

R1(config)# ip prefix-list NO-R3 deny 192.168.3.0/24
R1(config)# ip prefix-list NO-R3 permit 0.0.0.0/0 le 32
```

Prefix lists are usually preferred for route filtering, while access-lists are usually better for data plane traffic. This is because prefix-lists match on both mask and network, while access lists cannot match on mask.
