Route Summarization means there are no routes for child addresses in the RIP routing table, reducing the size of the table and allowing the router to handle more routes. Summary IP address functions more efficiently than multiple individual advertised IP routes for the following reasons:
- The summarized routes in the RIP database are processed first
- Any associated child routes that are included in a summarized route are skipped as RIP looks through the routing database, reducing the processing time required.

If auto-summary is enabled, as soon as RIP determines a summary address is required in the RIP database, a summary entry is created in the RIP routing database. As long as there are child routes for a summary address, the address remains in the routing database.

RIPv2 route summarization requires that the lowest metric of an aggregated entry, or the lowest metric of all child routes, be advertised.

With summarization, you lose routing details which can lead to suboptimal routing.

Always turn off auto-summary if you are routing between discontiguous networks, especially with RIPv1.

**show ip protocols** command will verify which routes are summarized for an interface.
