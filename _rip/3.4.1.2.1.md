Sometimes with RIP configuration, it may become necessary to manipulate the metric (hop count). One way this can be done is with the combination of an **offset-list** and an access-list. The offset-list adds the number specified to the metric of the route entry matching a *standard* access-list. The access-list matches the route for which to apply the offset-list. You use the keywords **in** and **out** with the offset-list to determine if the offset-list should change the metric on inbound Response Messages it receives or outbound Response Messages it sends. Here is an example configuration.
```
access-list 1 permit 10.33.0.0 0.0.0.0
router rip
  network 192.168.12.0
  network 10.0.0.0
  offset-list 1 in 2 Serial0
```
This one says examine RIP advertisements coming in interface Serial 0. If they are for the 10.33.0.0 network (from access-list 1), then add 2 hops to the metric.

The Serial0 in the offset-list configuration above is optional. If you do not specify an interface the offset-list will apply to all updates sent or received out of all interfaces.

Extended access-lists are not supported with offset lists.

Offset Lists are supported for RIP and OSPF, but not OSPF.
