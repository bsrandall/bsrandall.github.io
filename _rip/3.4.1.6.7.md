In the previous article we saw using Administrative Distance to filter routes. In that example, we used a 0.0.0.0 network to filter routes from any source for a particular route prefix. You can also get granular and specify different distances to be assigned to a prefix based on source host.
```
`R1(config)# router rip
R1(config-router)# distance 255 192.168.4.0 0.0.0.255 1
R1(config-router)# distance 109 192.168.5.0 0.0.0.255 1
R1(config-router)# exit
!
R1(config)# access-list 1 permit 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.255
R1(config)# exit
```
\`
The commands above would discard RIP Updates from 192.168.4.0/24 for the prefix 192.168.3.0/24, but would install RIP Updates from 192.168.5.0/24 for the prefix into the routing table.
