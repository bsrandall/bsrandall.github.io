RFC 1723 for RIPv2 provided for only plain text passwords. This was achieved by reducing the available number of routes in a RIP message from 25 to 24 and including the plain text password in the first route entry. However, there is an Authentication Type field in the RIPv2 message format, and Cisco takes advantage of this to provide better security.

Cisco decided to offer MD5 authentication by using the first and *last* route entries of a RIP message for MD5 authentication. The Authentication Type for this is 3.

The configuration of md5 is the same as for plain text - just specify the **md5** authentication type instead of text.
