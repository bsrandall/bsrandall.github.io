This is my first post in my newly launched blog. I decided to go with Jekyll and a GitHub page for my blog backend. I wanted my content to be in Markdown, as that seems to be the authoring flavor of the day. Jekyll and GitHub just made sense due to their support of Markdown.

Our knowledge is at its pinnacle when we can fluidly explain topics to others. That is my main motivation for this blog. There most likely will not be any ground breaking content, but I hope to explain some of the topics in a way that makes sense.

The other two benefits to my blog is hopefully improving on my Markdown and typing skills. It is sad that I still type as badly as I do, considering how much I type. I will use Markdown highlighting for code samples. TextExpander should make all of this a little easier.

This is some sample IOS commands using Markdown:

```SW1# switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q```
```SW1# switchport mode trunk```

Well I am off to the races. Or as most of those who have gone before me stress, off to start the marathon!
