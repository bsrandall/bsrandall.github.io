PPP stands for point-to-point protocol - it is  a very popular method for establishing a serial connection over which to pass IP traffic. PPP is composed of Link Control Protocol (LCP) as well as a family of NCPs used to establish network-layer links for various protocols (such as IPv4) after LCP has established the basic link. The steps to enable PPP on a Cisco router are shown below.
```
`R1(config)# interface serial0/0
R1(config-if)# encapsulation ppp
