RIP exchanges UDP encapsulated packets over UDP port 520. RIP has two message types:
- **Request messages** are used to ask neighboring routers to send an update
- **Response message** carries the actual update

When a RIP router process starts, it broadcasts a Request message out *each* RIP-enabled interface. The begins the state machine with neighbors receiving a RIP request and responding with a RIP Response.

When the requesting router receives the Response message, it processes the enclosed information and responds in one of 3 ways, depending on the information in the RIP Response.
1. If a route in the Response is new, it is entered into the route table along with the address of the advertising router.
2. If there is a route for a network that RIP has already entered into the table and the new route has a lower metric (hop count), then the new route will replace the old route.
3. If there is a route for a network that RIP has already entered into the table and the new route has a higher hop count and the update was originated by the recorded next-hop router, the router will be marked as unreachable for a specified holddown period. If the same neighbor is still advertising the higher hop count at the end of the holddown timer, the routing table is updated with the new metric.

RIP does not store information received in a Topology table, nor do routers have a picture of the entire topology. They receive routes in Response messages, process the information in those messages, and then move on. The RIP Response messages contain that routerâ€™s full routing table, with the exception of routes that are stressed by the split-horizon rule.
