IST is the Internal Spanning Tree, also known as instance 0. This instance is designated to carry all STP information, including information from other instances. MSTP does not send BPDUs for ever instance separately - these are all contained within the IST BPDU.

To accommodate, the other instances information is carried within the IST BPDU using special M-Record fields - one for every active MSTI. These fields carry carry MSTP information such as bridge priority, root path cost, and port priority.

IST also plays a huge role in multiple MSTP region configurations. When a switch receives a BPDU from another region, it marks the corresponding port as MSTP *boundary*. The interconnected, different region switches then form a CIST spanning across the regions.
