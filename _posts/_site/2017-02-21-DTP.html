<p>Dynamic Trunking Protocol is a Cisco proprietary protocol that, when configured, attempts to negotiate trunking between two connected ports. It will try to negotiate trunking as well as the encapsulation type.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">SW1# switchport mode dynamic auto</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>allows the interfaces to become a trunk if the neighboring trunk is set to trunk or desirable mode</li>
  <li>this is the default setting for newer Cisco switches</li>
  <li>if both ends of a trunk are set to dynamic auto, they will not form a trunk</li>
</ul>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">SW1# switchport mode dynamic desireable</code></p>
<ul>
  <li>makes the interface actively attempt to negotiate trunking</li>
  <li>the link will become a trunk if the neighbor interface is set to trunk, auto, or desirable</li>
</ul>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">SW1# switchport nonegotiate</code></p>
<ul>
  <li>prevents the interface from sending DTP frames</li>
  <li>can use this when the interface switch port mode is <em>access</em> or <em>trunk</em> only</li>
  <li>if enabled, to establish a trunk the neighbor interface must be manually set to <em>trunk</em></li>
</ul>
