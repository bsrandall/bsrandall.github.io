<h4 id="trunks">Trunks</h4>
<p>Dot1q is the standard trunking protocol used for transporting multiple VLANs across a trunk port. A trunk is a point-to-point link that carries the traffic for multiple VLANs across a single trunk. Dot1q is a standard that tags VLANs for identification. The receiving switch will then strip the VLAN tag from the frame before passing it to the appropriate access port.</p>

<p>The full name for Dot1q is IEEE 802.1Q.</p>

<p>The 802.1Q Tagged frame looks like this:
<img src="http://bsrandall.github.io/public/img/802.1q.png" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>The PRI field is the 3-bit 802.1p priority field.</li>
  <li>The CFI field is always set to 0 for Ethernet switches</li>
  <li>VLAN ID is a 12-bit field</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of the extra fields, an 802.1Q frame has an MTU of 1522 bytes.</p>

<p>If a non-802.1Q enabled device or an access port receives a tagged frame, it simply ignores the frame and forwards it as usual.</p>

<h4 id="native-vlan">Native VLAN</h4>
<p>A Native VLAN on a trunk is the VLAN to which untagged traffic belongs. Across a trunk, the Native VLANs should match on each end.</p>
