<p>By default, all VLANs are allowed to traverse an 802.1Q trunk once it is active. To restrict which VLANs are allowed to cross a trunk, you must go into IOS and explicitly define the VLANs that are allowed.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">SW1# switchport trunk allow VLAN 15-20,22,25</code></p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">SW1# switchport trunk allowed vlan add 27</code></p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">SW1# switchport trunk allowed vlan remove 18</code></p>

<p>You must remember that if an allowed VLAN list is already configured on a trunk, issuing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">SW1# switchport trunk allowed vlan 16-20,2,25</code> command will overwrite the previously defined VLANs. You must use the <em>add</em> and <em>remove</em> commands if there is already an allowed clan configuration in the running config.</p>
