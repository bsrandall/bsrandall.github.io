<p>CDP is a layer 2, Cisco proprietary device discovery protocol. Even though it is a Layer 2 protocol, it provides information about Layer 3 protocols (such as IP address). CDP operates by its member devices sending multicasts to the link-local multicast address 01:00:0c:cc:cc:cc (same as VTP). The member devices listen for multicasts at that address, process them accordingly, and store the information in a local table. The announcements are sent out every 60 seconds by default.</p>

<p>SNAP (Subnetwork Access Protocol) is required to run CDP, so effectively CDP can run on any data-link protocol that supports SNAP. Ethernet, Frame Relay, and ATM are example medias that support SNAP and thus CDP.</p>

<p>CDP relays the information about devices by Type-Length-Value (TLV) fields in the CDP packets. The <em>Length</em> is the length (in bytes) of the Type-Value-Length fields. The Type and Value fields are described below.</p>

<h4 id="type">Type</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Device ID - 0x0001</li>
  <li>Address - 0x0002</li>
  <li>Port ID - 0x0003</li>
  <li>Capabilities - 0x0004</li>
  <li>Version - 0x0005</li>
  <li>Platform - 0x0006</li>
  <li>IP Prefix - 0x0007</li>
  <li>VTP Management Domain - 0x0009 {: .red}</li>
  <li>Native VLAN - 0x000a {: .red}</li>
  <li>Duplex Status - 0x000b {: .red}</li>
  <li>Appliance ID - 0x000c {: .red}</li>
  <li>Power consumption - 0x0010 {: .red}</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="value">Value</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Device ID - MAC address in ASCII or the FQDN</li>
  <li>Address</li>
  <li>Port ID - ASCII string that names the port from which the message was sent</li>
  <li>Capabilities - has a value describing the device capabilities:
    <ul>
      <li>0x01 - level 3 routing</li>
      <li>0x02 - level 2 transparent bridging</li>
      <li>0x04 - level 2 source-route bridging</li>
      <li>0x08 - level 2 switching not running Spanning Tree</li>
      <li>0x10 - sends and receives packets for a network layer protocol</li>
      <li>0x20 - the device does not forward IGMP reports</li>
      <li>0x40 - level 1 function</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Version - software version running the device</li>
  <li>Platform - ASCII string describing the device (e.g. Cisco 7000)</li>
  <li>IP Prefix - a set of 0 or more IP Prefixes</li>
</ul>

<p>Switches see the MAC multicast address used by CDP as a special address and will not forward it out of other interfaces on a switch. Routers do not forward layer 2 frames out of their interfaces ever, so therefore only directly connected neighbors receive the CDP advertisement.</p>

<p>The beauty of CDP is that if you walk into a network and you do not know the topology, you can use CDP to quickly learn the entire layout of the network (as long as all the devices are Cisco!).</p>
