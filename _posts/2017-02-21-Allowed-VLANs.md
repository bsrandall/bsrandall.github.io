By default, all VLANs are allowed to traverse an 802.1Q trunk once it is active. To restrict which VLANs are allowed to cross a trunk, you must go into IOS and explicitly define the VLANs that are allowed.

	SW1# switchport trunk allow VLAN 15-20,22,25

	SW1# switchport trunk allowed vlan add 27

	SW1# switchport trunk allowed vlan remove 18

You must remember that if an allowed VLAN list is already configured on a trunk, issuing the `SW1# switchport trunk allowed vlan 16-20,2,25` command will overwrite the previously defined VLANs. You must use the *add* and *remove* commands if there is already an allowed clan configuration in the running config.
