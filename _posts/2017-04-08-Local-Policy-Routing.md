In a previous post, we saw how policy based routing can be used to change the next hop IP address for traffic matching certain criteria that is passing through the router. But what about traffic that originates on the router?

It is very similar but we use a different source on our access-lists (obviously) and we use a different command (global instead of sub-interface) to activate it.

Let’s assume our router has interfaces on the 192.168.12.0/24 and 192.168.13.0/24 subnets. Let’s set up Local Policy Routing to ensure that traffic originated on these interfaces and destined for 4.4.4.4 is sent to a next-hop IP address of 192.168.13.3. First, we set up our access lists.
```
`R1(config)# ip access-list extended ICMP-R1
R1(config-ext-nacl)# permit imp host 192.168.12.1 host 4.4.4.4
R1(config-ext-nacl)# permit imp host 192.168.13.1 host 4.4.4.4
R1(config)# end
```
`Now the next step would be to use a route map to set the next hop IP when we have a match.
```
`R1(config)# route-map PBR-R1 permit 10
R1(config-route-map)# match ip address ICMP-R1
R1(config-route-map)# set ip next-hop 192.168.13.3
R1(config)# end
```
`Now, we must make sure we activate it. Unlike with policy based routing, for local policy routing we enable it globally.
```
`R1(conf)# ip local policy route-map PBR-R1
R1(conf)# end
```
`
That is all!
