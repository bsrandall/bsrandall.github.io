Dynamic Trunking Protocol is a Cisco proprietary protocol that, when configured, attempts to negotiate trunking between two connected ports. It will try to negotiate trunking as well as the encapsulation type.


```SW1# switchport mode dynamic auto```

- allows the interfaces to become a trunk if the neighboring trunk is set to trunk or desirable mode
- this is the default setting for newer Cisco switches
- if both ends of a trunk are set to dynamic auto, they will not form a trunk

```SW1# switchport mode dynamic desireable```
- makes the interface actively attempt to negotiate trunking
- the link will become a trunk if the neighbor interface is set to trunk, auto, or desirable

```SW1# switchport nonegotiate```
- prevents the interface from sending DTP frames
- can use this when the interface switch port mode is *access* or *trunk* only
- if enabled, to establish a trunk the neighbor interface must be manually set to *trunk*
