There are 3 timers we need to be concerned with in Spanning Tree: the Hello Time, the Forward Delay, and the Max-Age Time.

The Hello Time is the frequency with which BPDUs are transmitted from the root bridge. It can be adjusted with the command `spanning-tree vlan 1-4094 hello-time 3` where 3 is in seconds. The default is 2 seconds, but in can be adjusted between 1 and 10 seconds. Non-root bridges will never generate BPDUs, but only relay BPDUs they receive on their root port.

The Forward Delay is the time that is spent in the listening and learning states. Its value is 15 seconds by default, but it can be adjusted to anywhere between 4 and 30 seconds.

The Max Age timer controls the maximum length of time that passes before a bridge port saves its configuration BPDU. This time is 20 seconds by default, but it can be tuned to be anytime between 6 and 40 seconds.

There is another item that is not a timer but is related. This is the *message age*. The root bridge sends all of its BPDUs with a message age of 0. Each downstream switch then adds 1 to this message age value. The actual age out time of the downstream switches is then (max age - message age).

Here is a good article that describes the Max Age timer as it relates to superior BPDUs:  [Max Age][1]. If a switch’s root port goes down, there is no need for it to go through the Max Age timer process - if there are no better BPDUs received, the switch will immediately start announcing itself as root and begin sending BPDUs. In the scenario in the article, the switch that went down is sending inferior BPDUs, but yet the receiving switch goes through the Max Age process before it transforms its non-designated port to a Designated Port and begins sending the superior BPDUs towards the switch that suffered the down link.
