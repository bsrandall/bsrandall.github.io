#### Standard VLANs
Cisco calls VLANS 1 - 1005 Normal VLANs. Of those, VLAN 1 is the Cisco default. You can use this VLAN, but your are not allowed to delete it. VLANs 1002 - 1005 are the Cisco defaults for FDDI and Token Ring. These also cannot be deleted.

That leaves us VLANs 2 - 1001 as Normal VLANs that we can add or delete as we wish.

VLANs 2 - 1001 are pruning eligible, while VLANs 1006 - 4094 are not.

When you delete a VLAN, any LAN ports configured as access ports for that VLAN become inactive until you assign them to a new VLAN.


#### Extended VLANs
Extended VLANs are in the range of 1006 - 4094. Extended range VLANs are not controlled by VTP and cannot be pruned. The router must be in VTP transparent mode in order to create extended VLANs.

Extended range VLANs are not stored in van.dat
