Enhanced Object Tracking is a sort of glue that binds the tracking of objects with upper layer protocols such as HSRP. Before Enhanced Object Tracking, HSRP could only look at interface line-protocol state for simple up / down status. Now you can create an advanced object (such as  an IP SLA object) and keep HSRP informed of the state of that object by using Enhanced Object Tracking.

Enhanced Object Tracking provides complete separation between the objects to be tracked and the action to be taken by a client when a tracked object changes. The tracking process periodically polls the tracked object and notes any change of value. The changes can be communicated immediately or after a delay to the interested client process.

Enhanced Object Tracking is used with IP SLA to track the output from IP SLA objects and use the provided information to trigger an action. Every IP SLA operation maintains a return-code value. Two aspects of an IP SLA operation can be tracked, state and reachability. The difference between these is the acceptance of the OverThreshold return code. The table below shows the state and reachability aspects of IP SLA operations that can be tracked.

| **Tracking**      | **Return Code** | **Track State** |
| State | OK | Up |
|Reachability | OK or OverThreshold | Up |

For both State and Reachability, all other return codes return down.

#### Examples

The first example is IP-Route Reachability. This tracks the reachability of a particular IP Route. A tracked object is considered up when a routing table entry exists for the route and the route is accessible.
```
`R1(config)# track timer ip route 20
R1(config)# track 4 ip route 10.16.0.0/16 reachability
R1(config-track)# delay up 30
R1(config)# end
```
`In the above example, the `track timer` is an optional command that specifies an interval in which the tracking object polls the tracked object. The default for IP-Route Reachability is 15 seconds.

The `delay` option specifies a period of time to delay communicating state changes of a tracked object.

The next example is using Tracking to poll an IP SLA operation. First we set up the IP SLA operation.

R1(config)# ip sla 1
R1(config-ip-sla)# icmp-echo 150.1.3.3
R1(config-ip-sla-echo)# frequency 30
R1(config-ip-sla-echo)# exit
R1(config)# ip spa schedule 1 start-time now life 10800
R1(config)# exit

Next, we set up the tracking.
```
`R1(config)# track 1 ip sla 1 state
R1(config)# delay up 60 down 30
R1(config)# end
```
`
Now the tracking object can be used by other clients to monitor the IP SLA object we set up earlier. One interesting note here. We could have used state or reachability for our tracking object. The only difference with ICMP echo operation is that reachability also ensures that the latency is less than 5000ms
