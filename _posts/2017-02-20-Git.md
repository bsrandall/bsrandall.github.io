I am not a git master, nor do I strive to become one. But I do need to know some basic details to manage this blog as well as my INE VIRL configurations. There are probably better ways to do this, but for my purposes, these are the commands I am running to push my updates from my MacBook to by GitHub page:

`~/Dropbox/jekyll.bsrandall.github.io(master) >> git add --all`
`Â ~/Dropbox/jekyll.bsrandall.github.io(master) >> git commit -m "update notes"`
`~/Dropbox/jekyll.bsrandall.github.io(master) >> git push -u origin master`
